# Bangla-Handwritten-Character-Recognition
Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition using different CNN architectures.

## Overview
The handwritten character recognition problem which varies among different languages due to distinct shapes, strokes and number of characters has been studied extensively during the last few decades with varying level of success. In case of Bangla Handwritten Character Recognition, here I tried different CNN architectures and made few modifications to improve the result. However, I used [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to train the models and PC for furthers works. An overview of this project is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvCAFmg2emI&ab_channel=MehediHasanBijoy).

## Train A Particular Model
#### Part_1: In Colab
1. Upload the ModelName.ipynb file in colab.
2. Upload the Dataset.zip file in LeNet.ipynb's Files section. 
3. Run the notebook.
4. Two files will be saved after the training completed. Download both FileName.h5 and FileName.json files.
#### Part_2: In PC
5. Run LoadModel.ipynb and follow the notebook for further work.
